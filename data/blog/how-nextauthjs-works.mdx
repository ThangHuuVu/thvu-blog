I did a write-up and a live stream about how NextAuth.js works at the source level, released as a Tour De Source article in collaboration with Sourcegraph.
Huge thanks to the Sourcegraph folks and [@Balázs Orbán](https://twitter.com/balazsorban44) for reviewing the document. You can check it out at:
