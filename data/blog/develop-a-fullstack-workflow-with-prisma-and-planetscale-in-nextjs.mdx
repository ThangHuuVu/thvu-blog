# Intro

After [shamelessly copied the guestbook feature](/blog/over-engineering-thvu-dev#guestbook) from [Lee Robinson](https://twitter.com/leeerob), I was committed to creating something original for my site. Today, let's discuss how I created a workflow when developing an Endorsement System using the same powerful stack: Next.js + PlanetScale + Prisma. (We probably need a name for this stack soon). Visit [Endorsements](/endorsements) to see the result âœ¨.

## The tech stack

[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) (still in beta) is a serverless database platform that is gaining interest amongst hobbyists in the industry lately for many good reasons: a generous free tier, the exciting [database branching model](https://docs.planetscale.com/concepts/branching), the scaling possibility, etc.

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is a collection of tools that abstract away the complex works when working with a database for you: migrations, safe-typing, etc. It is a great complementary to TypeScript applications.

## Database design for the Endorsement System

At first, I planned to have only two tables: `endorsements` and `skills` for the simplest form of implementation. Later, I have the chance to add `skill_category` in the mix for better visualization. Here's the database design in [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home):

# The workflow

## Preparations (Do this once)

- Register & create your database on PlanetScale.
  - In Database -> Settings, you need to turn on **Automatically copy migration data**. Choose **Prisma** as Migration Framework. Save the settings.
- Create a [shadow database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/shadow-database). Because PlanetScale is a cloud-hosted database, you need to create this manually: `pscale branch <branch> --database shadow`
- Add these values to `.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3309/<db>"
SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3310/<db>"
```

- Prepare the `schema.prisma` file with the following configurations:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["referentialIntegrity"]
}

datasource db {
  provider             = "mysql"
  url                  = env("DATABASE_URL")
  shadowDatabaseUrl    = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")
  referentialIntegrity = "prisma"
}
```

You can read more about Referential Integrity in Preview in the [3.1.1 release note](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/3.1.1) of Prisma. They introduce this feature to work around PlanetScale limitation not support defining foreign keys.

## Schema migration

### TL;DR

The steps are:

1. Create a new database branch on PlanetScale `pscale branch <branch> --database <database>`
2. Connect to the newly created branch and shadow branch using two separate terminals:
   - `pscale connect <database> <branch_name> --port 3309`
   - `pscale connect <database> shadow --port 3310`
3. Branch on git: `git branch new_branch`
4. Start creating migrations by editing `schema.prisma`
5. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>` in another terminal.
6. Create deploy request: `pscale deploy-request create <database> <branch>`
7. Merge the deploy request and PR on GitHub.
8. Close the opened connections.
9. Rinse and repeat.

### Longer version - Endorsements

As I mentioned before, I initially wanted two databases for simplicity. My steps:

- Create a branch on PlanetScale and named it `endorsements`.
- Connect to that branch and the shadow branch using
  - `pscale connect <database> endorsements --port 3309`
  - `pscale connect <database> shadow --port 3310`
- On my git feature branch, I edit the schema as follow:

```prisma
model skills {
  id           BigInt         @id @default(autoincrement())
  name         String         @db.VarChar(255)
  endorsements endorsements[]
  @@unique([name])
}

model endorsements {
  id          BigInt  @id @default(autoincrement())
  endorsed_by String  @db.VarChar(255)
  email       String  @db.VarChar(255)
  skill       skills? @relation(fields: [skill_id], references: [id])
  skill_id     BigInt?
}
```

- On point. After finished editing the schema, running Prisma Migrate: `npx prisma migrate dev --name endorsements` created a `<timestamp>_endorsements_migration.sql` file for me:

```sql
-- CreateTable
CREATE TABLE `skills` (
    `id` BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- CreateTable
CREATE TABLE `endorsements` (
    `id` BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `endorsed_by` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `skill_id` BIGINT,

    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

- `endorsements` is ready to be merged to `main`! I can then shut down the two opened connections to `endorsements` and `shadow`, and also delete `endorsements`.

The rest of the feature is just Next.js you know and love: [API endpoints](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), `getStaticProps`, etc. Check out [my first PR](https://github.com/ThangHuuVu/thvu-blog/pull/34/files) and [the follow-up PR](https://github.com/ThangHuuVu/thvu-blog/pull/48) for adding `skill_categories`.

### Tips

#### Mapping Prisma schema with the databases

You might want to name your database in a hyphen_case, while at the same time also want to stick with the Prisma schema naming convention using PascalCase as I do. In this case, use `@@map()`:

```prisma {7, 19, 29} showLineNumbers

model SkillCategory {
  id                 BigInt  @id @default(autoincrement())
  name               String  @db.VarChar(255)
  skills_in_category Skill[]

  @@map(name: "skill_categories")
}

model Skill {
  id           BigInt        @id @default(autoincrement())
  name         String        @db.VarChar(255)
  endorsements Endorsement[]

  skill_category    SkillCategory? @relation(fields: [skill_category_id], references: [id])
  skill_category_id BigInt?

  @@unique([name])
  @@map(name: "skills")
}

model Endorsement {
  id          BigInt  @id @default(autoincrement())
  endorsed_by String  @db.VarChar(255)
  email       String  @db.VarChar(255)
  skill       Skill?  @relation(fields: [skill_id], references: [id])
  skill_id    BigInt?

  @@map(name: "endorsements")
}
```

#### Manipulate data with Prisma Studio

So far we have used Prisma Schema and Prisma Migrate in our workflow. The third tool from Prisma is [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio), really useful when you want to do direct operations on the database. Make sure you have the correct `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` before firing this up.

# Conclusion

You should be able to adapt the workflow and use it in your projects by the end of this article. Here's' the workflow again:

1. Create a new database branch on PlanetScale `pscale branch <branch> --database <database>`
2. Connect to the newly created branch and shadow branch using two separate terminals:
   - `pscale connect <database> <branch_name> --port 3309`
   - `pscale connect <database> shadow --port 3310`
3. Branch on git: `git branch new_branch`
4. Start creating migrations by editing `schema.prisma`
5. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>` in another terminal.
6. Create deploy request: `pscale deploy-request create <database> <branch>`
7. Merge the deploy request and PR on GitHub.
8. Close the opened connections.
9. Rinse and repeat.

This workflow enabled a delightful Fullstack experience, as I hardly ever need to leave my VSCode & Terminal to change my schema. If you like this blog post, consider [endorse me](/endorsements)! ðŸ˜‰

Check out [David Parks's post](https://davidparks.dev/blog/planetscale-deployment-with-prisma/), he wrote an excellent article about the same subject. My article offers slightly newer information on how to set up Prisma regardings the `referentialIntegrity` value.
