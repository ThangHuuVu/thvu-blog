Read on to learn how I bootstrapped this site from template starter to the current over-engineered state. I called it over-engineered because I think I over-killed the site by optimizing the Lighthouse score, CSP headers, and all the service integrations I squeeze in it ðŸ˜…

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" asDisclosure />

# Get started

## Template

I use [@Tim](https://twitter.com/timlrxx)'s [awesome starter template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) to bootstrap the project. The template is feature-rich, easy to customize, and easily the best starter for Next.js blogging out there.

## Hosting

Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), with domain from Google Domain.

# Enhancements

## Blogging

I enhance the current writing feature with [mdx-embed](https://www.mdx-embed.com/). For me, it is always nice to have the ability to embed examples from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). To have this I need to add CodePen to MDX components:

```js
import { CodePen } from "mdx-embed";

const MDXComponents = {
  // ... other components
  CodePen,
};
```

And it is done! I also added a new feature, which is Real-time page view count using [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) (More on this later in Guestbook section below)

## <a href="/guestbook">Guestbook</a>

This feature is inspired by [Lee Robinson's guestbook](https://leerob.io/guestbook) and was fun to work with. I learned from him how to set up and use [PlanetScale for serverless database](https://leerob.io/blog/mysql-planetscale) (previously using [redis with Upstash](https://leerob.io/blog/serverless-redis-nextjs)).

My tweak in the implementation is authentication for guest users. I used [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) to integrate with Github, Google, and Line to provide authentication.

### Authentication with next-auth

#### Install

```shell
yarn add next-auth
```

#### Configure providers

Create a `[...nextauth].js` file in `pages/api/auth`:

```js
import NextAuth from "next-auth";

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    /* ...providers */
  ],
});
```

Be sure to check with the design guideline to implement the login buttons correctly. Details on how to integrate with each provider are also available on [next-auth's documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/). Below is a summary for my providers:

| Providers | Why                                    | Design guideline                                                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google    | Most common login OAuth is a must have | [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines) |
| Github    | For developers                         | [Github](https://github.com/logos)                                   |
| Line      | My current employer ðŸ˜Ž                 | [Line](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/login-button/) |

#### Custom Sign In page

To override the default `/signin` page, create a custom page and refer it in `[...nextauth].js`:

```js
export default NextAuth({
  // ... other configs
  pages: {
    signIn: "/auth/signin",
  },
});
```

### With Google Analytics

#### View a page

Check out the Next.js official example [with-google-analytics](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-google-analytics). It covers almost everything you need to integrate GA into your Next.js app.

#### Get pageviews

I use this to display all views for my site.

I use [this snippet](https://leerob.io/snippets/google-analytics) to get `pageviews`. Notice that now Google is rolling out GAv4 that removed the `View` panel. Therefore, if you want the snippet to work, in your Google Console you need to create a **Universal Analytic Property** and use its ID:

- From your Analytics Admin, click on **Create Property**
- Enter the property name and click on **Show advance options**
- Enable **Create a Universal Analytics property**. Check both **Create both a Google Analytics 4 and a Universal Analytics property** and **Enable enhanced measurement for Google Analytics 4 property**

## SSG with DatoCMS

Instead of using the `/data` directory for projects data, I decided to integrate with [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/) for some [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) vibes. The process is quite simple:

- Register a new account at DatoCMS
- Add DatoCMS integration in Vercel
- Fetch the GraphQL API in `getStaticProps`

I found everything I need in the Next.js [cms-datocms example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-datocms) and [DatoCMS documentation](https://www.datocms.com/docs). Working with DatoCMS graphql is a nice experience, as I have never worked with graphql before.

> Tips with environment variables: Make use of the Vercel CLI. After added an integration, you can use `vercel env pull` to get the ENV variables to your local `.env` file. I found this to be pretty handy when integrating services.

## ðŸŽ§ Now Playing with Spotify

Another feature [stolen from Lee](https://leerob.io/blog/spotify-api-nextjs) ðŸ˜„. See his article to learn how to set things up with Spotify API.

The Music Equalizer component is my touch, which is also available on CodePen as a CSS-only version. The visual is taken from Instagram story's music equalizer.

<CodePen codePenId="OJpqEKV" />
&nbsp;

The end result âœ¨

<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
  <video
    autoPlay
    playsInline
    controls
    loop
    src="/static/blog/over-engineering-thvu-dev/spotify-playing.mov"
  ></video>
</div>

# Lighthouse score

The generated site already has a very high Lighthouse score. I added PWA and _perfected_ the bars. Lighthouse report is available [here](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=fabc591d26e4f40c2d4446ed962a629d).

<Tweet tweetLink="thanghvu/status/1434148959602176000" />
What I improved compared to the starter project:

- PWA: Better icons, manifest
- SEO: Added robots.txt

## PWA

The easiest way to implement PWA support in a Next.js project is to use [next-pwa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-pwa).

### favicons

I use https://realfavicongenerator.net to generate the icons.

### `manifest.json`

To get the perfect score for PWA, ensure the following in `icons`:

- A 512x512 image for [splash screen](https://web.dev/splash-screen/)
- An image with `purpose: any maskable`. I use [maskable.app](https://maskable.app/editor) to help with this.

# Content Security Policy

Websites I use to get CSP rating:

- https://securityheaders.com
- https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com

If you are implementing CSP for your site, my suggestion is to start with [super strict CSP (lockdown)](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp#use_case_2_lockdown) and build from there.

# Monitoring with Sentry

Sentry with Next.js is a delightful experience. The steps are:

- Go to https://sentry.io to register for a free tier account.
- Add Sentry integration to Vercel.
- Install the package and run the wizard:

```shell
yarn add @sentry/nextjs
npx @sentry/wizard -i nextjs
```

I only want Sentry in production. To do this, in my `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = isDevelopment
  ? nextConfig
  : withSentryConfig(nextConfig, SentryWebpackPluginOptions);
```

> `withSentryConfig` has to be the farthest wrapper to ensure that your source maps include changes from all other Webpack plugins.

# Conclusion

And there you have it, my over-engineered site, my sweet home on the internet. I learned a lot from other people while building this site. I hope you learned something from this post too. I will continue to upgrade this site in the future, hopefully with more original ideas. Stay tuned for future posts!
